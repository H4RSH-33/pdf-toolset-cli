# 🛠️ PDF Toolset CLI – A Python-Based PDF Utility

Welcome to **PDF Toolset CLI**, a lightweight command-line utility built with Python that allows you to perform essential PDF operations — completely offline and with ease.
---

## 📌 Features

This toolset provides 4 useful operations:

1. **Merge PDFs**  
   ➤ Combine multiple PDF files into one consolidated document.

2. **Extract Metadata**  
   ➤ View detailed information like Author, Title, Subject, Producer, Creator, and Total Pages of a PDF.

3. **Compress PDFs**  
   ➤ Reduce the file size by compressing page content streams (note: compression is basic due to PyPDF2 limitations).

4. **Add Blank Pages**  
   ➤ Add any number of blank pages at the **start** or **end** of an existing PDF.

🎯 Learning Goals & Highlights
This mini project was my first deep dive into using Python libraries for real-world use cases. Key takeaways:

✅ Explored PyPDF2 as the first external library in my learning journey

✅ Practiced modular function design and CLI structure

✅ Built logic for input handling, error catching, and user-friendly feedback

✅ Learned about the internal structure of PDFs — including pages, metadata, and compression
